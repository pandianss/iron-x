# DISCIPLINE MODEL

## Philosophy
The `iron-x` system is a discipline enforcement mechanism. It treats discipline not as a preference, but as a contract.

### Metallurgical Hardening
Like metallurgy, Iron-X **tempers soft human intentions into hardened behavioral contracts**:
- **Phase Transformation**: Converting aspirational goals ("we should") into binding constraints ("we must")
- **Work Hardening**: The system becomes more resistant to deviation through repeated enforcement cycles
- **Immutability**: Once policies are deployed, enforcement mechanisms cannot be bypassed

## Core Principles
1. **Deterministic Enforcement**: Logic must be predictable and non-negotiable.
2. **Neutrality**: No motivational language, praise, or gamification.
3. **Execution Integrity**: The system exists to ensure intentions transition to actions.

## System Domains
- **Auth**: Identity verification.
- **Discipline**: Habit and action tracking.
- **Enforcement**: Hard lockout and restriction logic.
- **Policy**: Structural rules binding.
- **Scoring**: Mathematical representation of discipline.
- **Scheduler**: Time-bound execution control.
