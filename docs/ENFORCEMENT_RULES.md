# ENFORCEMENT RULES

## Lockout Thresholds
- **Consecutive Misses**: 3 (Hard Lockout)
- **Execution Lag**: > 4 hours (Warning/Restriction)
- **Discipline Score < 20**: Total System Lockout

## Enforcement Actions
1. **Restricted Mode**: Limited access to non-essential functions.
2. **Hard Lockout**: Manual intervention or cool-down required.
3. **Audit Trigger**: Immediate logging of failure states.

## Rule Evolution
Changes to enforcement rules require Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) and explicit approval.
