# POLICY BINDINGS

## Roles
- **Standard**: Baseline enforcement.
- **Strict**: Accelerated lockout thresholds.
- **Institutional**: Centralized policy enforcement.

## Binding Logic
Policies are bound to users/teams via `PolicyID`. Binding is immutable for the duration of a discipline cycle.

## Scope
Policies cover:
- Action limits
- Enforcement modes
- Reporting frequency
