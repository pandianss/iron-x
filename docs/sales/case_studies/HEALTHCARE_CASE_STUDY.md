# Case Study: Iron-X in Healthcare
## Saving Lives through Systemic Discipline

**Client**: MediCore Regional Hospital (500+ Staff)

### The Challenge
MediCore struggled with "Shift Drift"—the gradual degradation of handover protocols between nursing shifts.
- **Problem**: Critical patient information was being missed during verbal handovers.
- **Risk**: Medication errors and HIPAA violations were rising.
- **Cost**: 14% staff turnover due to burnout from correcting avoidable errors.

### The Iron-X Solution
MediCore deployed Iron-X Enterprise across 12 wards.
1.  **Digital "Hard Handover"**: Nurses cannot clock out until the Iron-X Shift Verification protocol is complete.
2.  **Role-Based Policies**: Head Nurses verified compliance via the Cockpit Dashboard.
3.  **Audit Readiness**: Automatic logging of every protocol acknowledgement.

### The Results
- **100% Protocol Compliance**: Within 2 weeks of "Hard Mode" enforcement.
- **Zero HIPAA Violations**: In the annual audit.
- **Reduced Burnout**: Nurses reported feeling "safer" knowing the system caught errors for them.
