# Case Study: Iron-X in Manufacturing
## Precision at Scale: The Zero-Drift Factory

**Client**: Apex AutoParts (Tier 1 Automotive Supplier)

### The Challenge
Shift changeovers were bleeding efficiency. The "15-minute overlap" was effectively becoming 30 minutes of unstructured chatter and slow startup.
- **Problem**: Machine calibration drift was not being caught until hours into the shift.
- **Cost**: $40k/month in scrap material from out-of-spec parts.

### The Iron-X Solution
Apex installed Iron-X kiosks at every station.
1.  **Calibration Gate**: Machines could not be started until the 'Calibration Check' action was marked complete in Iron-X.
2.  **Visual SOPs**: Iron-X displayed the exact setup diagram for the specific part run.
3.  **Team Velocity**: Shift supervisors monitored real-time completion of startup tasks.

### The Results
- **18 Minutes Saved**: Average reduction in shift startup time.
- **Scrap Reduced by 60%**: Improper calibration incidents effectively vanished.
- **ROI**: System paid for itself in 14 days.
