# STANDARD: Professional Ethics of Execution (ODS-ETH-001)

## 1. The Obligation to Execute
Professionals (Engineers, Managers, Doctors, Administrators) have an ethical obligation not just to *intend* good outcomes, but to establish the *conditions* that ensure them.

## 2. Execution Malpractice
It is considered **professional malpractice** to:
1.  Accept a critical responsibility without a corresponding enforcement mechanism.
2.  Design a system that relies solely on human vigilance for safety-critical steps.
3.  Remove or disable discipline enforcement tools without a formal risk assessment.
4.  Blame subordinates for "lack of motivation" when no systemic support for reliability was provided.

## 3. The "Silent Sentinel" Principle
A professional's work must continue to function even when the professional is absent, distracted, or unmotivated.
*   **Ethical Standard:** If your system collapses because you had a bad day, you have failed your professional duty.
*   **Duty:** You must build systems that protect the mission from your own fallibility.

## 4. Institutional Norms
Organizations adopting this code of ethics must:
*   Reward **System Builders** over **Firefighters**.
*   Penalize **Heroics** that were necessary due to lack of **Process**.
*   Treat **Reliability Data** as a public utility within the firm, not private property.

## 5. Oath of Reliability (Draft)
"I will not rely on hope as a strategy. I will typically bind my future self to action through unbreakable systems. I will not blame others for the failures of the environments I design."
