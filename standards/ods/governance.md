# ODS Governance Model

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Status:** ACTIVE

## 1. Stewardship
The Open Discipline Standard is maintained by the **ODS Stewardship Council**, a localized neutral body (initially the originating engineering team, transitioning to independent board).

### 1.1. Core Principles
1.  **Vendor Neutrality:** No feature shall favor a specific proprietary tool.
2.  **Backward Compatibility:** V2.0 must be able to read V1.0 records.
3.  **Simplicity:** Complexity is a barrier to discipline.

## 2. Contribution Process (ODS-RFC)
Changes to the standard occur via **Request for Comments (RFCs)**.

### Lifecycle:
1.  **Draft:** Author proposes a change.
2.  **Review:** 30-day public comment period.
3.  **Last Call:** 7-day final objection window.
4.  **Accepted/Rejected:** Council vote.

## 3. Conflict Resolution
In the event of disagreement on definition (e.g., "Does checking email count as an Action?"), the standard defaults to **strict interpretation** (No, unless explicitly intent-bound).

## 4. Licensing
The ODS Specification is released under **CC-BY-ND 4.0** (Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives). Implementations may be proprietary, but the standard definition is shared.
