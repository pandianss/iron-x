# Academic & Professional Review Strategy

**Focus:** Systems Engineering, Behavioral Economics, Project Governance

## 1. Review Questions
We seek feedback from the academic community on the following:
1.  **Metric Validity:** Does the `DisciplineScore` algorithm accurately reflect "reliability" without bias?
2.  **Habit Formation:** Is the "Enforcement" model consistent with current research on habit formation (e.g. cue-routine-reward loops)?
3.  **Governance:** Is the ODS specification truly vendor-neutral?

## 2. Review Artifacts
- **White Paper:** "The Mathematics of Accountability" (Drafting in progress)
- **Technical Brief:** "ODS v1.0 Architecture Constraints"

## 3. Targeted Institutions
- **Project Management Institute (PMI):** For standard alignment.
- **Behavioral Science Departments:** For psychological validity.
- **Open Source Standards Bodies:** For schema governance.
